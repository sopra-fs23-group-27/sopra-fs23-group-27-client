## Requirements

1. **Stable Internet Connection**: FlagMania is an online game, players will need a stable internet connection to play. We recommend a minimum internet speed of 5 Mbps for a smooth and seamless gameplay experience.
2. **Web Browser**: FlagMania is a web-based game, so players will need a web browser to play. We recommend using the latest version of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox for the best experience.
3. **Devices**: FlagMania is a web-based game, so players will need a device to play. We recommend using a laptop or desktop computer for the best experience. The use of smartphone and tablet devices is discouraged and may lead to a suboptimal experience.  If a user still chooses to play on a smartphone, playing in side view is recommended!

## Technologies
To establish a seamless connection between the frontend and backend, we have employed REST and Stomp-Websockets protocols. REST (Representational State Transfer) enables smooth communication and data transfer, allowing the frontend to interact with the backend effortlessly. Stomp-Websockets, a subprotocol of WebSocket, adds a layer of real-time communication, ensuring instant updates and an immersive gameplay experience.

Speaking of APIs, we have integrated two exceptional sources to bring the User of our applicaton accurate and up-to-date information. The first is the FLAGCDN API (https://flagcdn.com/), which supplies us with an extensive collection of country flags. With this API, we ensure that each flag displayed in the game is authentic and visually appealing (specifically, it was difficult finding an API that provides flags in high resolution), enhancing your learning experience.

Additionally, we have integrated the Country API from API Ninjas (https://api-ninjas.com/api/country) to provide the user of our application with fascinating facts surrounding each country. This API allows us to enrich the gameplay by helping the user guessing the flag with hints ranging from interesting trivia to helpful insights about the nations behind the flags.

### Frontend specific technologies
At the forefront, we have utilized [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for the frontend development, ensuring a robust and scalable user interface. TypeScript enhances the development process by adding static typing and improved tooling to JavaScript, resulting in a more reliable and efficient Frontend experience.

[Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) is a React-based framework that provides a collection of customizable components and hooks. Mantine is used to build the frontend components, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user interface. Mantine's components are highly customizable, allowing to tailor the user interface to our needs and preferences.

## High-level components
The [GameLobby component](https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-27/sopra-fs23-group-27-client/blob/main/src/views/GameLobby.tsx) class is a React component that represents the UI and functionality of a game lobby. It manages the state of the lobby, including player information, lobby settings, and game URLs. It also handles events such as starting the game and leaving the lobby. The GameLobby component is a crucial component in the frontend that enables players to create and join lobbies, as well as start games. The [GameRound component](https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-27/sopra-fs23-group-27-client/blob/main/src/views/GameRound.tsx) represents the view of a single round of the game on the frontend side. It manages the display of flag images, user interactions, displayal of hints and the submission of guesses (basic and advanced modes). This class handles the players guesses, updates the UI with other players wrong guesses, and progresses the game to the round summarizing scoreboard. It communicates with the backend, and in particular with the WebSocketService through Stomp-Websockets to fetch flags and hints and send guesses. The [GameEnd component](https://github.com/sopra-fs23-group-27/sopra-fs23-group-27-client/blob/main/src/views/GameEnd.tsx) renders the end screen of a game, displaying the ranking and scores of players. It subscribes to WebSocket messages to receive updated player data, including names, scores, and game statistics. It also provides options for players to play again, go back to the home screen, or register to save their stats if they are not permanent players. The GameEnd component is a crucial component of the game, since the player must be informed about his ranking. Only this way, she can adjust her flag learning experience and excell at the game.

## Roadmap
There are several features a new developer, who is desperate to contribute could add.
1.	The application does currently not come with mobile support. In order to grow the user base, this could be a vital new feature to FlagMania.
2.	A new developer might also consider adding support for multiple languages to make the game accessible to a global audience as well as allow users to switch between different language options and provide translations for flag names, instructions, and other textual elements.
3.	More exciting game are also considered a great expansion of FlagMania. Once could for example think of a timed mode where players must answer as many flags correctly as possible within a set time limit.
4.	Encouraging social interaction can enhance the game's community aspect and promote player engagement. One could think of integrating social media platforms or in-game chat functionality to facilitate communication and interaction among players. This could include features like sharing scores on social media platforms and inviting friends to play through short messages.
