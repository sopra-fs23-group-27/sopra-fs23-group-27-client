              Do you know very little about the flags of countries from all over
              the world? Then try Basic Mode first! Here you will be shown
              possible answers and you have to choose the country that matches
              the displayed flag.
            </li>

              Are you already a real flag expert? Then try the Advanced Mode!
              Here you must type the correct country directly into an input
              field. To the right you can even see the wrong guesses of the
              other players. The round ends when the first player has guessed
              the correct country.

          Can you hold your own against the other players? Do you already have a
          user login? If no, then register as soon as possible! There are great
          advantages waiting for you. For example, you can protect your username
          and view your overall statistics. To do so, go to the register page on
          the homepage and log in. Alternatively, you can also register after
          playing a round!
