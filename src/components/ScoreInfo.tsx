          Are you confused with the numbers that are displayed? Here is what
          they mean: For each player you see their overall current rank, current
          total score, current total number of correct guessed countries, the
          time each player had to submit their first guess (right or wrong)
          during the previous round and an answer distribution:{" "}
          <ol>
            <li>
              The current overall rank is entirely determined by the current
              score.
            </li>
            <li>
              The current score is computed as follows: - If the player did not
              manage to identify the flag correctly, the score is 0. - If the
              player did manage to identify the flag correctly, the score is
              computed as follows: (10 * the number of consecutively correct
              guesses*1) + (100 / the time until the first guess*2) - (the
              number of times you have not guessed correctly). After each round,
              the score of the last round is added to the score of the previous
              rounds.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have guessed the country correctly, you are awarded one
              point in the "correct guesses" column, else 0.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the column "Time Until Correct Guess" you see the time until
              each player submitted their first guess (right or wrong). If no
              guess was submitted, the full length (in seconds) of the last
              round is assigned!
            </li>
            <li>
              The answer distribution displays the number of countries guessed
              correctly relative to the number of rounds played!
            </li>
            <li>
              The flame icon indicates the player has guesses two or more
              countries correctly in a row.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <i>
            *1: For example, if you guessed the country correctly in the last 2
            rounds, you get 10 * 2 = 20 points here; If you have guessed the
            country correctly in the round before the last round but have not
            guessed it correctly in the previous round, you get 0 points here as
            the guesses must be correct consecutively!
